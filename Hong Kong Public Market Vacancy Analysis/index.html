            <p class="quote-text">Is the public market losing its relevance? We spoke to a housewife who still visits the Yeung Uk Road Market in Tsuen
            Wan for its wide variety of goods, but her visits have dropped to just once a week. She admits that the market has lost
            its bustle and that its potential closure would have little impact on her life, given the abundance of street shops and
            supermarkets. Her sentiment reflects a wider trend across the city. As shoppers turn to more convenient alternatives,
            the silence in these hubs is growing. Between 2022 and 2024, the average vacancy rate across Hong Kong’s public markets
            climbed from 12.64% to 17% (FEHD, 2024).</p>

                    The government launched a flagship HK$2 billion "Market Modernization Programme" to upgrade facilities
                    and install air
                    conditioning. They also introduced public auction policies, offering steep rental discounts to attract
                    tenants to
                    long-term vacant stalls. Yet, the impact has been limited.

<!--Public Market Unwelcome in wealthy districts-->

    <div class="macro-container">
    <h2 class="macro-title">Public Market Unwelcome in Wealthy Districts?</h2>
    <p class="macro-text">
        Why aren't these fixes working? Some point to a deeper structural shift. Research by scholar Marinelli (2019) suggests
        the culprit may be gentrification. As property values in districts like Central soar, the working-class families and
        elderly residents—the market's loyal customer base—are priced out and displaced. This demographic shift drains the
        neighborhood of its daily shoppers, suggesting that empty stalls are an inevitable symptom of a wealthier, but less
        dense, city.
    </p>
    <p class="macro-text">
        However, the notion that gentrification is driving markets out of business doesn't stand up to scrutiny. A look at the
        numbers shows the correlation coefficient between district income levels and market vacancy rates stands at a negligible
        0.0028, effectively zero. This means that markets in wealthier areas do not necessarily face more severe vacancy
        problems.
    </p>
    <p class="macro-text">
        For example, the Central and Western District boasts the highest per capita monthly income in Hong Kong at HKD 42,400.
        Yet, its markets are far from empty. The Queen Street Cooked Food Market saw a 0% vacancy rate in 2024. Other markets in
        the district—including Smithfield Market (4%), Sheung Wan Market (11%), and Shek Tong Tsui Market (13%)—all reported
        vacancy rates lower than the citywide average. In fact, income explains virtually just 0.01% of the differences in
        vacancy rates, meaning the remaining 99.99% stems from factors unrelated to household earnings, such as rent levels,
        ageing facilities, and fluctuating foot traffic.

                The outlier markets reveal the consequences of these structural issues. For the Stanley Waterfront Mart (80%), while the
                tourism slump is a significant factor, vendors point to excessively high rents (Chow, 2025). The lowest starting bid for
                a stall in August 2024 was set at an eye-watering HK$5,820, compared to just HK$350 at the Tin Wan Market (FEHD, 2024)
                in the same district. Maintaining such high rental levels when foot traffic is low makes survival impossible.
            </p>
            <p class="micro-text">
                The Quarry Bay Market (51%), sitting in a higher-income district, yet lacks amenities like air conditioning and suffers
                from an ageing building with no recent renovation (FEHD Committee Document No. 12/2024). In an area crowded with modern
                supermarkets, the absence of basic comforts makes it difficult to attract or retain shoppers.
            </p>
            <p class="micro-text"> 
                These cases underscore a central finding: street market vacancies are shaped not by district wealth but by individual,
                on-the-ground conditions and governance rigidity. Revitalisation demands targeted, district-level strategies.

<!--FEHD VS NGO-->
<section class="final-section">
    <h2 class="micro-title">FEHD Restrictions VS. Community-Led Solutions</h2>
    <div class="final-single-block">
        <p>
        The stories from Stanley and Quarry Bay, combined with insights from the NGO Alliance on the Development of Public
        Markets, reveal the true complexity of the issue. Aillance, founded in 2012, argues the core problem is twofold:
        changing consumer needs and inflexible management.

            <h3>FEHD Restrictions</h3>
            <p>
                The government's "Market Modernization Programme" is a start, and it has attempted to lower reserve prices. However,
                Aillance notes that progress is slow, and authorities lack the flexibility to approve changes in stall usage, often
                citing regulatory constraints. Unlike private markets, FEHD-managed facilities have strict restrictions on the type of
                business (e.g., only specific wet or dry goods), preventing stallholders from flexibly transforming their offerings to
                meet modern demand. Many successful external shops are run by former market vendors who moved out to escape these rigid
                regulations.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="final-midline"></div>
        <!-- RIGHT COLUMN -->
        <div class="final-col">
            <h3>Community-Led Solutions</h3>
            <p>
                Aillance has proposed a transformative approach: repositioning long-term vacant stalls for non-traditional uses. The
                spaces don't have to sell meat or vegetables; they can be rented to provide services like nail salons or traditional
                Chinese medicine, or to NGOs for community services (e.g., community living rooms, repair stations), or to young people
                as startup testing grounds. This strategy aims to turn markets into a community gathering spot, rather than just a place
                for commerce.
            </p>
        </div>

    </div>
    <hr class="final-divider">
    <div class="final-single-block">
        <p>
            The path forward, then, is not in waiting for an HK$2 billion fix, but in hyper-local action. While the housewife from
            Tsuen Wan admitted the market's closure would have little impact on her life now, a renewed focus on community and local
            needs might be the only way to bring back the bustle she remembers and ensure that the next generation of shoppers finds
            a reason to keep visiting.
